a) A visual inspection would probably be a good place to start. Recognizing things like whether the data is discrete or continous, are there negative values, are they bounded? All are probably good questions to start with
b)
```{r}
set.seed(5)
```
c)
```{r}
N<-100
```
d)
```{r}
x<- rnorm(N, mean=5, sd=3)

```
e)
```{r}
mean(x);sd(x)
```
mean(x) and sd(x) represent the mean and standard deviation of the data we have generated.

f)
```{r}
negLL<- function(mu, sigma){
  R = dnorm(x, mu, sigma)
  -sum(log(R))
}
```
g)
```{r}
library(stats4)

mle(negLL, start=list(mu =2, sigma=6), method="L-BFGS-B", lower=c(-Inf, 0), upper=c(Inf, Inf))
```
